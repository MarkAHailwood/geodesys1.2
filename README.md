# Geodesys1.2

This is an html applicaiton that uses vue.js, bootstrap 4 and axios as script tags. It's is simple yet capable, whilst the previous example was complicated and geared for scale and use accross all browsers. Although the code is far less substantial, I prefer it as it performs the tasks required while not being bloated. Clean code is as simple as possible. Testing and data logging to be added as time allows.
